# DotNetCore3.1-RPG (Role playing Game)

A Small text based role-playing game where different users can register (using JSON web tokens for authentication) and create their own characters like a mage or a knight, add some skills and a weapon, and also let character fight against each other to see who is the best of them all!

This application is only backend web API and does not contain any User interface.
I am seeking to add the UI part soon in future.

P.S. - This application was created by following a course nsmed .Net Core 3.1 Web API & Entity Framework Core Jumpstart by Patrick God on Udemy
Link the course is here : https://www.udemy.com/course/net-core-31-web-api-entity-framework-core-jumpstart/
